                    My name is Edward Tang and I am a junior at Dublin High 
                    School. Currently I consider myself a jack of all trades 
                    and have yet to decide what I will master. I am interested 
                    in STEM and have aspirations to attend a university with a 
                    strong department in that field. However, I am going to 
                    keep my options open for as long as possible before I 
                    decide. In school I am taking a wide variety of courses. I 
                    enjoy challenging myself, so I am determined to take the 
                    most heavy workload possible.

                    Balancing multiple AP classes with extracurriculars 
                    requires a great deal of time-management skills. My 
                    schedule constantly needs to be tweaked so I can study for 
                    an upcoming test or work on a group project.

                    White Stag Leadership Camp is a a summer camp that teaches 
                    leadership skills to youth. After completing the program as 
                    a candidate, I joined Youth Staff and became a counselor. 
                    Part of my commitment is to attend monthly weekend-long 
                    meetings. Although this leaves me with very little 
                    time to focus on academics, my leadership skills have grown 
                    immensely. I am currently in my third year as a member of 
                    Youth Staff. I plan to continue with the program through 
                    the rest of high school.

                    Often it seems that academics and fun are completely 
                    unrelated, but it doesn't always have to be that way. 
                    The experience of coding this website was a novel and 
                    challenging, but also enjoyable. Have a look around!

                <!--    Rough Draft of About Me
                Most of the time I am busy doing homework and keeping up with my
                classes. I haven't yet decided what I want to study in college, 
                so right now I'm taking a wide variety of subjects. On the 
                occasions that I find myself with nothing to study for, I like 
                to spend my time reading books. My parents want me to read 
                about chemistry and calculus, but I much prefer the fantasy
                genre. Among my favorites are the Redwall series and the
                Inheritance cycle. For excersize, I enjoy biking and hiking. 
                Some days I ride my bike to the library after school for some
                peace and quiet. I like to hike local mountains and trails 
                during breaks or long weekends. As member of a venture crew, I
                also get the opportunity to camp out every month for a whole 
                weekend. It's a welcome respite from the torments of my older
                brother and younger sister. With parental attention split 
                between the three of us, I am often left to my own devices. 
                I have a great deal of experience with procrastination as a 
                result. I have yet to master the art of self-motivation, but the
                timely creation of this website is certainly a testament to my
                progress. Have a look around!
